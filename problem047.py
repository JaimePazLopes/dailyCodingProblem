# Problem #47 [Easy]
# Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order,
# write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once.
# You must buy before you can sell it.
#
# For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5,
# since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.


# instantly went for this nÂ² time solution, but after i could see a linear one

# easy problem, the first solution came instantly, the second one i need to iterate on the first some times to see that
# nested loops are not necessary. 30 minutes to do everything
