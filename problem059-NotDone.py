# Problem #59 [Hard]
# Implement a file syncing algorithm for two computers over a low-bandwidth network.
# What if we know the files in the two computers are mostly the same?
#
# honestly i dont even know where to start on this one, tried to google some stuff, but didnt found much.
# And most of what i found have a high complexity. Maybe in the future i have some more knowledge to try this again.
