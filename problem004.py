# Problem #4 [Hard]
# Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space.
# In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array.
# The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

# this was the first thing that pass in my mind: if the array is sorted is easy. clearly not linear

# the first two solutions (sorted and going integer by integer) came fast, in less than 30 minutes both were thought,
# implemented and tested. the last solution was hard, i really tried to get there alone, spend more than 1 hour without
# get any solution, i just understood that to do that more linearly i would need different checks for different
# cases (i mean lots of if ... return). I also understood that i would need to run the list more than one time,
# but 2n or 3n still linear. the realization that each number could have its own position on the array came looking
# online, but it took me more than 1 hour of search and almost one more hour to implement covering every case I thought
